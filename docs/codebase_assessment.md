# Codebase Assessment for Snake Zero

## Overview
This document provides an assessment of the current state of the Snake Zero codebase, focusing on size, complexity, and the use of JSDoc annotations.

## Size
- The codebase includes multiple directories such as `core`, `entities`, `powerups`, and more, indicating a modular structure.
- The `src` directory contains around 20 files, suggesting a moderate-sized codebase.

## Complexity
- The presence of a main file (`main.js`) that integrates various components suggests some complexity, especially in managing game logic and state.

## JSDoc Annotations
- Detailed JSDoc comments are present, providing a foundation for adding type annotations during the conversion process.

This assessment helps in understanding the current state of the codebase and guides the prioritization of components for conversion to TypeScript.
