# Entities Conversion Plan for TypeScript

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for converting the `entities` directory from JavaScript to TypeScript. This directory includes the definitions for key game entities such as the snake, food, and power-ups.

## Conversion Order

1. **Food.js**
   - Start with this file as it might be simpler and can serve as a good starting point for conversion.

2. **PowerUp.js**
   - Convert the power-up logic next to establish a foundation for handling game enhancements.

3. **Snake.js**
   - Tackle the snake entity last due to its complexity and central role in the game.

## Steps for Conversion

- **Rename Files**: Change the file extensions from `.js` to `.ts`.
- **Add Type Annotations**: Use existing JSDoc comments to guide the addition of type annotations.
- **Compile and Test**: Regularly compile the codebase to catch type errors and run tests to ensure functionality remains consistent.

This plan focuses on converting critical game entities to TypeScript, leveraging existing documentation to guide the process.
