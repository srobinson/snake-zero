# Key Areas Identification for TypeScript Conversion

## Overview
This document identifies the key areas of the Snake Zero codebase that are most critical and should be prioritized for conversion to TypeScript.

## Priority Areas

### Core Logic
- The `core` directory likely contains essential components like the game loop and state management. These should be prioritized due to their central role in the application's functionality.

### Entities
- The `entities` directory defines game entities like the snake and food, which are crucial for gameplay and should be converted early.

### Main Entry Point
- The `main.js` file is the main entry point and integrates various components, making it a priority for conversion.

### Utilities
- The `utils` directory may contain helper functions that are widely used across the codebase, making it important to convert these early for type safety.

This identification helps in focusing efforts on the most critical parts of the codebase during the conversion process.
