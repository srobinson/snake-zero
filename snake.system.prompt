Always use config values
When creating a new value, create it in the config file
Ensure all config values are used, list unused values
Ensure all functions are used, list unused functions
Read ./requirements.md as a reminder of our main goals
Read ./suggestions.md for next step ideas

Always examine full codebase before making a change unless absolutely certain the change is local and safe
After making big changes, reexamine the codebase to make sure it still works
Always ensure ./README.md is up to date and accurate
Follow ./CONTRIBUTING.md checklist for all changes

NEVER delete code without seeking approval!

# Change Process Requirements

1. Before any changes:
   - Review snake.system.prompt
   - Check ./requirements.md
   - Review current README.md
   - Identify affected files

2. During changes:
   - Document changes as they're made
   - Update configurations systematically
   - Keep track of documentation needs

3. After changes:
   - Update README.md
   - Verify documentation accuracy
   - Ensure examples work
   - Remove outdated information

4. Documentation is not optional:
   - It is part of the change, not an afterthought
   - Must be updated in the same step as code changes
   - Must be accurate and complete
   - Must include working examples
